Security Hub begins running security checks within two hours after you deploy PCI DSS and AWS FSBP controls. After the initial check, subsequent checks occur on a periodic or change-triggered basis, depending on the control. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-schedule.html[Schedule for running security checks^]. Follow the steps in this section to test the deployment.

The following steps test remediation of the link:#_coverage[PCI EC2.2] control. This control states that the VPC default security group should prohibit inbound and outbound traffic, and it is evaluated on a change-triggered basis. To test it, purposefully misconfigure security group settings in the Amazon EC2 console to allow inbound traffic. This should trigger a Security Hub finding which remediates the security issue by undoing the misconfiguration in the console.

. Choose *Security Groups* in the Amazon EC2 console. 
. Choose the *Security group ID* of the default VPC.
. Choose *Edit inbound rules*.

. Select *Add rule*.
. Select *SSH* as the *Type* and *0.0.0.0/0* as the *Source*.

. Select *Save rules*. Make a note of the security group Amazon Resource Number (ARN).
. In Security Hub, select *Findings*. Locate the finding that corresponds to the misconfiguration.
. Select the check box next to the finding and select *Actions*.
. Select *PCI EC2.2* from the drop-down list. A message displays that findings were successfully sent to AWS CloudWatch Events.
. In Systems Manager, select *Automation*. You should see a successful automation execution that corresponds to the PCI EC2.2 remediation.
. To confirm success of the remediation, select *Security Groups* in the Amazon EC2 console. Then select the *Security group ID* of the default VPC. Confirm that the SSH rule is removed from the *Inbound rules* tab.

TIP: For more information on the format of Security Hub findings, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-results.html[Results of security checks^].

== AWS Security Best Practices
AWS categorizes each Security Hub service action into one of five access levels: list, read, write, permissions management, or tagging. To allow a large group of users to access list and read Security Hub actions, and only a small group to access the write action, use managed IAM policies. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html[Security best practices in IAM^].

Security Hub ingests findings generated from integrated providers (both third-party services using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-findings-format.html[ASFF^].
