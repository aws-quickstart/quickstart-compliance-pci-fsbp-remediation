Customers require compliance with established security and regulatory controls when migrating workloads to AWS but face numerous challenges. It is a multi-step process that involves reference to standards and regulatory requirements, individual policy definitions, remeditaion workflows, and exception procedures. Furthermore, several remediation steps may require extensive hands-on experience with AWS as individual findings require multiple configuration steps for remediation. This activity is manual, error prone, and results in a high MTTR (Mean Time To Remediation) for customers thus increasing risk and operational costs.

AWS Security Hub provides checks that offer automated detection of findings of configuration noncompliance with PCI DSS and AWS FSBP. This Quick Start leverages the AWS Security Hub service and provides customers with an AWS native implementation for automated real time remediations for PCI DSS and AWS FSBP policy violations detected by AWS Security Hub.

This Quick Start is based on the following approach:

[start=1]
. Leverages AWS Security Hub directly to provide automated and continuous detection and recording of PCI DSS and AWS FSBP findings.
. Provides AWS Systems Manager automation documents for automated remediation of AWS Security Hub findings. All automation documents are automatically provisioned via an AWS CloudFormation template.
. Provides integration of AWS Security Hub custom actions with AWS Systems Manager automation documents to provide real-time remediations of AWS Security Hub PCI DSS and AWS FSBP findings as follows:
.. Leverages the ability of AWS Security Hub to send findings associated with custom actions to Amazon CloudWatch Events as Security Hub Findings - Custom Action events.
.. The CloudWatch Events rule invokes the corresponding AWS Lambda function as the target for the Security Hub custom action event.
.. The AWS Lambda function processes the finding using the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) and invokes the corresponding AWS Systems Manager Automation Document with the input from the ASFF finding.
.. AWS Systems Manager remediates the Security Hub finding.

WARNING: The PCI DSS compliance standard in AWS Security Hub is designed to help you with ongoing PCI DSS security activities. The controls cannot verify if your systems are compliant with the PCI DSS standard. They can't replace internal efforts or guarantee that you will pass a PCI DSS assessment. Security Hub does not check procedural controls that require manual evidence collection.
