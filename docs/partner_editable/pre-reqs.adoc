. Security Hub uses service-linked https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html[AWS Config rules]. Make sure that AWS Config is turned on and recording all supported resources, including global resources, in all accounts and regions where Security Hub is deployed.

. The Quickstart provisions a KMS CMK (Customer Managed Key) to remediate the PCI.CloudTrail.1 control: "CloudTrail logs should be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS CMK". The key policy for this kms key needs to be updated with the specific AWS Account ID where the Quickstart is deployed so that the kms key has permissions to encrypt/decrypt AWS CloudTrail logs in that account. Navigate to the AWS KMS console and search for a kms key with an alias of "PCI-CMK" and follow the steps link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail.html#create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail-policy-sections[here] to update the kms key policy to encrypt/decrypt cloudtrail logs in your account.
