Deploying this Quick Start builds the following environment in the AWS Cloud.


Figure 1. Quick Start architecture for Remediations of PCI and Foundational Security Benchmarks using AWS Security Hub

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS Security Hub Custom Actions.
* AWS CloudWatch Events Rules where each rule consists of 1) an AWS Security Hub Custom Action as source 2) a custom action ID that represents the Security Hub Action Target Resource ARN and 3) a target that consists of a Lambda function to process the Security Hub Finding.
* AWS Lambda functions that process the findings using the standard findings format provided by Security Hub (AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF)). Each Lambda function invokes the associated AWS Systems Manager Automation Document with the finding.
* AWS Systems Manager Automation Documents that provide remediations for the AWS Security Hub Finding



Deploying this Quick Start builds the following environment in the AWS Cloud.


Figure 1. Quick Start architecture

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS Security Hub to compile findings of automated and continuous checks run against the rules in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standards. Custom actions in Security Hub send findings of deviations from best practices as AWS CloudWatch Events to AWS CloudWatch. 
* AWS CloudWatch to match a custom action event from AWS Security Hub with a rule that triggers an AWS Lambda function.
* AWS Lambda functions to invoke the appropriate AWS Systems Manager automation document based on the custom action.  
* AWS Systems Manager to perform the procedures in the automation document to remediate the initial finding.

NOTE: This guide contains instructions for deploying the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and Foundational Security Best Practices standards in Security Hub. Each standard is packaged in two templates. For more information, see the Launch the Quick Start section.
