As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS Security Hub with custom actions to compile findings of automated and continuous checks run against the rules of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP). Custom actions send PCI-DSS and FSBP benchmark findings to AWS CloudWatch. Each custom action contains a unique Amazon Resource Number (ARN). 
* AWS CloudWatch to match a custom action event emitted from AWS Security Hub with a rule that targets an associated AWS Lambda function.
* AWS Lambda functions to use the information in the custom action to trigger the appropriate AWS Systems Manager automation document.  
* AWS Systems Manager to perform the procedures in the automation document invoked by AWS Lambda to remediate the initial check.
